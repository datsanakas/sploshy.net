<title>English Spelling Reform Proposal</title>

# My Proposal for an English Spelling Reform

## Why change English spelling?
English spelling is horribly inconstent and difficult to master. The irregular orthography makes learning and pronouncing English difficult for foreign learners as well as for people with disabilities such as dyslexia. Native speakers can struggle to spell, and even experienced writers make spelling mistakes. In the past hundred years, many countries have replaced obsolete systems of currency, measurement, and spelling. Something similar is needed for English. 

Unfortunately, my reform of English spelling is probably not at all feasible, as it often differs greatly from its current form - it would be too much of a radical change to be widely accepted. Smaller changes would need to be made first.

## Consonants
Most of the consonants retain the sounds they currently use. The most noticeable difference in the use of consonants is that all instances of a given sound will be written the same, e.g. *z* used at the end of some plurals - *lads* becomes *ladz*.

Notably, the diagraph *dh* is introduced to represent the sound /ð/, so that it can be differentiated from /θ/. This is necessary but potentially confusing, as it changes the spelling of many elementary words, e.g. *that* becomes *dhat*. Similarly, the diagraph *zh* is introduced to represent /ʒ/.

Another important change is the use of *k* to represent all instances of /k/, i.e. *cat* becomes *kat*. I chose *k* not *c*, because the sound that it makes is indisputable and could not be confused for /s/ for example. I have decided to use *c* to represent /tʃ/, because is a shorter and more pleasing spelling than *tsh*, which is important, because /tʃ/ is a very common sound. It also reflects its use in Old English orthography - so it's not unprecedented. 

I have also included some spellings for uncommon sounds. /x/, which is mostly found in celtic loanwords, is represented with *kh*. The sound /ʍ/ (an unvoiced /w/), is stilled used in some accents (typically in words beginning with *wh*). Words that use this sound can still be optionally be spelled with *wh*.

In the case of the letters *x* and *q*, I am a bit undecided. For now *x* has no use, and *q* is used to represent /kw/.

IPA | Example in old orthography | New spelling
--:|---|---
/m/ | **m**at | m
/n/ | **n**ot | n
/ŋ/ | le**ng**th | ng
/p/ | **p**ot | p
/t/ | **t**op | t
/tʃ/ | **ch**at | c
/k/ | **c**at | k
/b/ | **b**at | b
/d/ | **d**ot | d
/dʒ/ | **j**ob | j
/ɡ/ | **g**et | g
/f/ | **f**at | f
/θ/ | **th**ing | th
/s/ | **s**ock | s
/ʃ/ | **sh**ot | sh
/x/ | lo**ch** | kh
/v/ | **v**an | v
/ð/ | **th**at | dh
/z/ | ra**z**e | z
/ʒ/ | plea**s**ure | zh
/h/ | **h**at | h
/l/ | **l**ock | l
/r/ | **r**ack | r
/j/ | **y**es | y
/w/ | **w**et | w
/kw/ | **qu**it | q
/ʍ/ | **wh**en | wh

## Vowels
In this spelling reform, instead of basing the spelling of vowel sounds upon their pronounciation in one accent, I have tried to create an accent-agnostic orthography, so that the reform will work in any accent of English (words will still be spelled differently in different dialects however, because words can also vary phonemically). To achieve this, I have used John. C. Wells' lexical sets, which identify words into a lexical set based on the pronounciation of their stressed syllable. Each lexical set has been given a unique spelling. Notice that some lexical sets might be pronounced in the same way in your accent.

Some unfamiliar letters have been introduced. An breve or inverted breve can now be added to some letters to represent another sound it could intuitively represent in the current spelling.  

To form the lexical sets which are diphthongs in most accents, I have used diagraphs ending with *w* and *y*. An *r* is used for the lexical sets that are typically pronounced with a /r/ or r-coloured vowel, but the *r* can be considered silent for non-rhotic speakers.

Lexical set | New spelling | Examples 
:--|---|---
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">kit</span> | i | ship, sik, brij, milk, mith, bizy
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">dress</span> | e | step, nek, ej, shelf, frend, redy
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">trap</span> | a | tap, bak, baj, skalp, hand, kansĕl
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lot</span> | o | stop, sok, doj, romp, posĕbl, qolity
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">strut</span> | ŭ | kŭp, sŭk, bŭj, pŭls, trŭnk, blŭd
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">foot</span> | u | put, bush, ful, gud, luk, wulf 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">bath</span> | ȃ | stȃf, brȃs, ȃsk, dȃns, sȃmpl, kȃf
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">cloth</span> | ŏ | kŏf, brŏth, krŏs, lŏng, Bŏstĕn
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">nurse</span> | ĕr | nĕrs, lĕrk, ĕrj, bĕrst, jĕrk, tĕrm
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">fleece</span> | iy | kriyp, spiyk, liyv, fiyl kiy, piypl

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">thought</span> | ȏ | tȏt, sȏs, hȏk, jȏ, brȏd
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">goose</span> | uw | luwp, shuwt, tuwm, myuwt, hyuwj, vyuw
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">goat</span> | ow | sowp, jowk, howm, now, sow, rowl
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">price</span> | ay | rayp, rayt, ĕrayv, hay, tray, bay
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">choice</span> | oy | ĕdroyt, noyz, joyn, toy, royĕl
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">mouth</span> | aw | awt, haws, lawd, kawnt, krawd, kaw 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">near</span> | ir | bir, sĕnsir, fir, bird, sirum
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">square</span> | ȇr | kȇr, fȇr, pȇr, whȇr, skȇrs, vȇri
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">start</span> | ȃr | fȃr, shȃrp, bȃrk, kȃrv, fȃrm, hȃrt
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">north</span> | ȏr | fȏr, wȏr, shȏrt, skȏrc, bȏrn, wȏrm

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">cure</span> | ur | pur, turist, pyur, plurĕl, jury

Some extra lexical sets are also defined for word-final unstressed syllables, and I have chosen spellings for them that roughly match up to the current orthography. *ĕr* and *a* are also used for other lexical sets, but this does not matter, as those sounds cannot be found at the end of words.

The unstressed vowel found in *hidd**e**n* or *purch**a**se*, which is usually pronounced /ə/ or /ɪ/, is represented by *ĕ*.

Lexical set | New spelling | Examples 
:--|---|---
happ<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">y</span> | y | kopy, skampy, taksy, sorty, kĕmity, hoky, Celsy
lett<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">er</span> | ĕr | peypĕr, mitĕr, kalĕndĕr, styȗpĕr, sŭkĕr, mȃrtĕr, figĕr
comm<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a</span> | a | kĕtalpa, qouta, vodka 

## Rules for common words
Many elementary English words have an unstressed form which occurs when the word is emphasised. In some words, such as *the*, the stressed form also occurs when the following word begins with a vowel.

Current spelling | Stressed | Unstressed
:--|---|---
the | dhiy | dhĕ
of | ov | ĕv
and | and | ĕnd
to | tuw | tĕ
a | ey | ĕ
an | an | ĕn
are | ȃr | ĕr

## Example text
> *The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.*
