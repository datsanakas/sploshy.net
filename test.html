<h1 id="My%20Proposal%20for%20an%20English%20Spelling%20Reform">My Proposal for an English Spelling Reform</h1>

<h2 id="Why%20change%20English%20spelling?">Why change English spelling?</h2>

<p>English spelling is horribly inconstent and difficult to master. The irregular orthography
makes learning and pronouncing English difficult for foreign learners as well as for people
with disabilities such as dyslexia. Native speakers can struggle to spell, and even 
experienced writers make spelling mistakes. In the past hundred years, many countries have
replaced obsolete systems of currency, measurement, and spelling. Something similar is
needed for English. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, my reform of English spelling is probably not at all feasible, as it often
differs greatly from its current form - it would be too much of a radical change to be
widely accepted. Smaller changes would need to be made first.</p>

<h2 id="Consonants">Consonants</h2>

<p>Most of the consonants retain the sounds they currently use. The most noticeable difference 
in the use of consonants is that all instances of a given sound will be written the same, e.g. 
<em>z</em> used at the end of some plurals - <em>lads</em> becomes <em>ladz</em>.</p>

<p>Notably, the diagraph <em>dh</em> is introduced to represent the sound &#47;ð&#47;, so that it can
be differentiated from &#47;θ&#47;. This is necessary but potentially 
confusing, as it changes the spelling of many elementary words, e.g. <em>that</em> 
becomes <em>dhat</em>. Similarly, the diagraph <em>zh</em> is introduced to represent &#47;ʒ&#47;.</p>

<p>Another important change is the use of <em>k</em> to represent all instances of &#47;k&#47;, i.e. <em>cat</em>
becomes <em>kat</em>. I chose <em>k</em> not <em>c</em>, because the sound that it makes is
indisputable and could not be confused for &#47;s&#47; for example. I have decided to use <em>c</em> to
represent &#47;tʃ&#47;, because is a shorter and more pleasing spelling than <em>tsh</em>, which is important, because &#47;tʃ&#47; is a very
common sound.
It also reflects its use in Old English orthography - so it&#39;s not unprecedented. </p>

<p>I have also included some spellings for uncommon sounds. &#47;x&#47;, which is mostly found in celtic
loanwords, is represented with <em>kh</em>. The sound &#47;ʍ&#47; (an unvoiced &#47;w&#47;), is stilled used in some
accents (typically in words beginning with <em>wh</em>). Words that use this sound can still be
optionally be spelled with <em>wh</em>.</p>

<p>In the case of the letters <em>x</em> and <em>q</em>, I am a bit undecided. For now <em>x</em> has no use,
and <em>q</em> is used to represent &#47;kw&#47;.</p>
